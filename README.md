# PdfSearch
A simple tool to search multiple pdf files for patterns

I needed a quick way to search text in a large number of pdfs for university, so I created this.

###Usage:
Select a path and click "Create Index"  
Enter your seach string  
Double click on a file to open it with the default pdf viewer

###Search patterns:  
a file must contain ALL patterns (no further boolean logic)  
separate patterns with whitespaces  
use quotation marks to include spaces in your pattern  
use ? / * to match any single or any number of characters
